## Overview

[Order Summary Card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj)

In this challenge, we had to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

For this project, I built it with these:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me that practice allows you to be better at something. Following my last challenge, I changed my body for centering the content to this below:

```
body {
...
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
...
}
```

The code above allowed me to vertically align all of my content (both main, and also the footer). Overall, it shows that I am improving in my HTML and CSS skills, and I'm quite happy with it!
